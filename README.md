# _Taproom React_

#### _This webpage will use React to rebuild the taproom project that I originally built using Angular.  06/29/18_

#### By _**Jimmy McNamara**_

## Description

_This project will use React to build a taproom menu that will display information on a list of beers. A version of this project was built in the past using Angular, this project will attempt to recreate that site as well as improve upon it using React, making it look cleaner and more interactive._

## Project Specs



## Future Project Specs

_There should be a header that shows up on every page of the site._
_The user should be able to see a list of beers when they load the homepage. Info will include, pours left on the keg, beer name, brewer, price and ABV._
_When a keg is tapped it should not allow you to pour anymore from it._
_When a keg is tapped it should give the option to change the keg._
_As a beer is served there should be a button to show this on the menu so users know how many pours are left for each keg._
_Pourers should be able to add a new beer to the menu list._
_Pourers should be able to edit a beer's information._
_If an invalid page is brought up it should show the user an error message._
_Only authorized users should be able to add or edit kegs._
